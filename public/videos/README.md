## Background Video

To add a custom background video to the application, please do the following:

1.  Find an MP4 video file you would like to use as the background.
2.  Rename the file to `background.mp4`.
3.  Place the `background.mp4` file into this directory (`/public/videos`).

The application is configured to automatically pick up and play this video. If the file is not present, the background will be black.
